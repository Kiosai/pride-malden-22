## ACCESSIBILITY
Malden Pride strives to be as inclusive and accessible as possible. If you have any access needs that we are not currently meeting, please email pridemalden@gmail.com and we will do our best to work with you. This is a fully volunteer-run event and competing access needs are relatively common so we cannot promise to make the event accessible for everyone, but we will do as much as we can.

### LANGUAGE
ASL interpreters are booked from 12:30PM to 4:30PM. They will be present for the speaking program at 1PM and the interfaith service at 4PM, as well otherwise avaialble between those times when they are not actively interpreting a main event.

We are currently in the process of finalizing interpreters for Spanish and Mandarin. These live translations will only be available in person at the park.

### MOBILITY
Coytemore Lea Park has a paved path throughout the entire park, with accessible entrances from both Mountain Ave and Clifton St. A lot of the park is grass and may not be suitable for most mobility aids; there is also a basketball court in the middle of the park where we will have limited seating available during the speaking program.

### PARKING
(Details forthcoming)

### PUBLIC TRANSIT
Coytemore Lea Park is near to the Malden Center MBTA Station. (Bus info forthcoming.)

### VIRTUAL ACCESS
The speaking program and interfaith service will be livestreamed (link to come). Between these events the livestream will be closed.

### COVID POLICY
As Coytemore Lea is a public park, we cannot enforce any covid precautions. However, we have several recommendations.
We ask that you keep masked whenever possible. Extra masks, including for kids, will be availalbe at the med tent.
Before removing your mask, make sure you have the consent of everyone near you - defined as roughly a six foot radius.

### FOOD
A limited amount of food will be available on a first-come first-serve basis. A limited number of vegan meals will be provided by our caterer. Please be respectful of others and only take the vegan meals if you need them.

A water truck will be present throughout the event. Bendable plastic straws will be availalbe.

### BATHROOMS
There will be two porta-potties. One is located on the Clifton St side of the park. The other is TBD.

### SENSORY
Earplugs will be available at the med tent.

### FRAGRANCES
While fragrances are a great way to affirm identity and self-sooth, we ask that you consider not wearing fragrances for the event, as they can trigger allergies in others.

### ANIMALS
Service animals are allowed by law. If you see any animals wearing service vests or paraphernalia, do not interact with them - let them do their job!
Dogs will be present throughout this event; please medicate accordingly if you have allergies.

### WEATHER
Malden Pride 2022 is a rain or shine event. There will be some shade tents throughout the park.
