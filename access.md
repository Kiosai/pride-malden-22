## ACCESSIBILITY
Malden Pride strives to be as inclusive and accessible as possible. If you have any access needs that we are not currently meeting, please email pridemalden@gmail.com and we will do our best to work with you. This is a fully volunteer-run event and competing access needs are relatively common so we cannot promise to make the event accessible for everyone, but we will do as much as we can.

### LANGUAGE
ASL interpreters are booked from 12:30PM to 4:30PM. They will be present for the speaking program at 1PM and the interfaith service at 4PM, as well otherwise avaialble between those times when they are not actively interpreting a main event.

There will be spoken interpretation in Spanish and Mandarin, also from 12:30 to 4:30PM. These live translations will only be available in person at the park.

### MOBILITY
Coytemore Lea Park has a paved path throughout the entire park, with accessible entrances from both Mountain Ave and Clifton St. A lot of the park is grass and may not be suitable for most mobility aids; there is also a basketball court in the middle of the park where we will have limited seating available during the speaking program.

### PARKING
There is a public parking lot on Dartmouth St across from the YMCA. There is also limited street parking on the surrounding side streets.

### PUBLIC TRANSIT
Coytemore Lea Park is a short walk from the Malden Center MBTA Station. The 131 Bus and 137 Bus stop at Main St at Mountain Ave.

### VIRTUAL ACCESS
The speaking program and interfaith service will be livestreamed (link to come). Between these events the livestream will be closed. We do not have live captioning availalbe but will enable autocaptioning.

### COVID POLICY
As Coytemore Lea is a public park, we cannot enforce any covid precautions. However, we have several recommendations.
If you are experiencing covid symptoms, have tested positive for covid, or have recently been exposed to anyone with covid - PLEASE STAY HOME! We are happy to have you join us virtually if that is the case.
In the park, we ask that you keep masked whenever possible. Extra masks, including for kids, will be availalbe at the med tent.
Before removing your mask, please do your best to ensure you have the consent of everyone near you - defined as roughly a six foot radius.

In the interest of economic accessibility, a limited amount of food will be available at no charge. Food will be served on a first-come first-serve basis. A limited number of vegan meals will be provided by our caterer. Please be respectful of others and only take the vegan meals if you need them. Please let a volunteer know during the event if you need a gluten-free or kosher meal, as we will have a few set aside.

A water truck will be present throughout the event. Bendable plastic straws will be availalbe.

### BATHROOMS
There will be two porta-potties. One is located on the Clifton St side of the park. The other is TBD.

### SENSORY

### FRAGRANCES AND SMOKING
While fragrances are a great way to affirm identity and self-sooth, we ask that you consider not wearing fragrances for the event, as they can trigger allergies in others.
For the same reason, we ask that you not smoke or vape in crowded areas.

### ANIMALS
Service animals are allowed by law. If you see any animals wearing service vests or paraphernalia, do not interact with them - let them do their job!
Dogs will be present throughout this event; please medicate accordingly if you have allergies.
