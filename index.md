## Malden Pride 2022

Malden Pride is a volunteer-run event that celebrates queerness, grounds itself in the historical meaning of pride, and brings the Malden community closer together.
This year is all about **CELEBRATION**. It's been a while since we've been together in person - let's make the most of it!

### Date, Time, Location

Saturday June 18th 2022, 11AM to 5PM, Coytemore Lea Park in Malden, RAIN OR SHINE.

Any additional funds raised or not spent will go towards our budget for next yearâ€™s Malden Pride celebration! You can donate here: [https://gofund.me/36b5d145](https://gofund.me/36b5d145).
